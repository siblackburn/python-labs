Some Tips
Creating a function that gets a "hand" based on a number.

The function should take in a number and return the string representation of the hand. E.g.:

def get_hand(hand):
    # 0 = scissor, 1 = rock, 2 = paper

    # for example if the variable hand is 0, it should return the string "scissor"
    pass
